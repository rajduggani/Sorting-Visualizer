# Sorting-Visualizer
Visualize how various Sorting Algorithms work using Python (tkinter). This project you'll visualize how different sorting algorithms work.
We'll see how rectangular bars of different lengths are sorted using various sorting techniques. We can Shuffle the bars by clicking 'Shuffle' button.
In this project I have implemented three sorting algorithms - Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.

# About
In Data Structures & Algorithms, we all have learnt sorting algorithms such Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort.
Most of the times we have practised or implemented on CLI or in theory. But, what if we visualize how these algorithms work?
How cool would it be? Yes.
